                            <p> Ill choose at random who gets it Note: Endless Space Disharmony IS A DLC not the actual game i'll check your profile to see if you have the game itself or not Endless Space Disharmony (http://store.steampowered.com/app/241430/). in 4X games like this, i'm more of a 'turtle', that is I concentrate on building up my empire/forces and rarely ever do early wars. I would have to say in these sort of games I'm a science/military type person, so with all these in mind what would your suggestions be in making a strong science/military custom faction and please explain why certain traits. Hey guys, If you're into Civ and other 4X games and love space, you'll really like Endless Space. The developer Amplitude really listen to their fans with their Games2Gether service, and the community is very active on their forums. Anyway, I have 50% off coupons (valid until Jan 1) for the game and the expansion, Disharmony. I really love Endless Space Disharmony, except for one thing: slogging through mid game combat. I never know when a war is going to start, and I never know what weapons/def mods an AI is going to have, and then I have to bust stack after stack of ships, potentially risking my hero, with game that discourages having reserves of ships due to high upkeep costs. My brain finally clicked and I realized why. Maybe someone can explain why a game is less fun when you get harshly penalized I am giving away one Steam 50% OFF coupon for Endless Space Emperor Edition and one for Endless Space Disharmony. Just comment here and let me know if you want either or even both. EDIT: Looks like no one is interested. As long as the flair doesn't say "Giveaway Over", I'll give both coupons to the first person See all the coupons in my inventory: First come first served. I've done a bit of research on this and still can't figure out if it's good or not. From what I can gather, the pros are that combat is actually interesting now, there are more options with invasions, and a lot of other small additions that make it more interesting. On the other hand, the ship designer is apparently worse, and the AI is ultra-aggressive to the point where diplomacy is pretty much rendered moot. I also remember hearing when it came out that the AI tweaks made the game WAY harder.
